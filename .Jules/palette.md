## 2026-02-20 - Command Aliases for Mobile Usability
**Learning:** In Telegram bots, long command names like `/enable_notifications` are cumbersome to type on mobile keyboards. Providing short aliases like `/enable` and `/disable` significantly improves the "interaction cost" for users.
**Action:** Always provide short-form aliases for frequently used configuration commands in addition to their descriptive full names.
